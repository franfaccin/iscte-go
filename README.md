# ISCTE - GO

![](iscte-go.gif)

This project was created for the _Information Processing_ curricular course (_Processamento de InformaÃ§Ã£o_) at [ISCTE](https://www.iscte-iul.pt/course/3/bachelor-bsc-in-computer-engineering/presentation). The objective of this course is to introduce students to the fundamentals of randomness in computing and communication engineering systems. To demonstrate the different kinds of application of random number generators, the goal was to create algorithms that transform a random number generated by `Math.random()`, which follows a uniform distribution, into any distribution we would like, like a binary distribution, Gaussian distribution, etc.

The files for generating a random variable (aka VA) can be found at `/src/VAs` and the constants configuration can be found at `src/config/config.js`.

## Before you start

You'll need [NODE.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed. Then run this in the project directory:

```sh
npm install
```

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## The Game

To play the game, just:

1 - Click on the Pokemon you desire to try and catch

2 - Click on the Pokeball to throw it

3 - Fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž

4 - Failed to catch it? Go back to step 2 before the Pokemon runs away!

5 - You catch it? Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ 

6 - Go back to town and try another one 

7 - How many can you catch?

## The Project

To learn more about the project and the random variables distrubution, you can check it [the project presentation slides](PI-APresentacao.pdf) (note: It's in portuguese).

To see the current values of the random variables you can check "Stats For Nerds" in the screen.
