## Information Processing (PI)

This project was created for the _Information Processing_ subject (_Processamento de Informação_) to demonstrate the different kinds of application of random number generators. The goal is to create an algorithm that transforms a random number generated by `Math.random()`, which follows a uniform distribution, into any distribution we would like, like a binary distribution, Gaussian distribution, etc.

The files for generating a random variable (aka VA) can be found at `/src/VAs` and the configuration constants can be found at `src/config/config.js`.
